Boilerplate fullstack project with Python and React


## Contributing

The project uses linters, and other checks, to enforce style and maintain code quality.
To enable/install them, I recommend using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to do
it so:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Source Code Tree
